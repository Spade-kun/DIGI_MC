# Email Notification System - Testing Guide

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed

### Issue 1: No Email Sent on User Registration
**Problem:** MAIL_MAILER was set to 'log' instead of 'smtp'
**Solution:** Changed `.env` file to use SMTP for actual email sending

### Issue 2: No Notification When Admin Approves/Rejects
**Problem:** Toast notifications weren't showing properly
**Solution:** Added enhanced toast notifications with auto-dismiss functionality

## üìß Email Notifications Now Working

### 1. **User Registration Email** (Pending Approval)
- **Sent to:** New user who just registered
- **Subject:** "Registration Pending - Awaiting Approval"
- **Content:** Informs user their registration is pending admin approval
- **Trigger:** When user completes registration form

### 2. **Account Approved Email**
- **Sent to:** User whose registration was approved
- **Subject:** "Account Approved - You Can Now Login!"
- **Content:** Informs user they can now login with their account
- **Trigger:** When admin clicks "Approve" button

### 3. **Account Rejected Email**
- **Sent to:** User whose registration was rejected
- **Subject:** "Registration Status Update"
- **Content:** Informs user their registration was not approved
- **Trigger:** When admin clicks "Reject" button

## üîß Configuration

### Current Email Settings (.env)
```env
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USERNAME=2201104232@student.buksu.edu.ph
MAIL_PASSWORD=vlmntyfalhpacppo
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS="2201104232@student.buksu.edu.ph"
MAIL_FROM_NAME="Laravel"
```

### Important Notes:
- ‚úÖ Using **App Password** (not regular Gmail password)
- ‚úÖ SMTP is properly configured
- ‚úÖ TLS encryption enabled
- ‚úÖ From address matches the Gmail account

## üß™ Testing Email System

### Test Command
We created a custom Artisan command to test email sending:

```bash
php artisan test:email [email-address]
```

**Example:**
```bash
php artisan test:email 2201104232@student.buksu.edu.ph
```

This will send a test "Registration Pending" email to verify the configuration.

## üìù Admin Dashboard Features

### Toast Notifications
When admin approves or rejects a user, toast notifications will appear showing:
- ‚úÖ **Success:** "User '[Name]' has been approved successfully! Email notification sent to [email]."
- ‚ùå **Error:** If something goes wrong, an error message will appear

### Auto-Dismiss
- Toast notifications automatically disappear after 5 seconds
- Can be manually closed with the √ó button

## üö® Troubleshooting

### If Emails Are Not Being Sent:

1. **Check .env file:**
   ```bash
   MAIL_MAILER=smtp  # Must be 'smtp', not 'log'
   ```

2. **Clear config cache:**
   ```bash
   php artisan config:clear
   php artisan config:cache
   ```

3. **Test email sending:**
   ```bash
   php artisan test:email your-email@example.com
   ```

4. **Check Gmail App Password:**
   - Make sure you're using an App Password, not your regular Gmail password
   - Go to: Google Account ‚Üí Security ‚Üí 2-Step Verification ‚Üí App passwords
   - Generate a new app password if needed

5. **Check Laravel logs:**
   ```bash
   tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log
   ```

### Common Errors:

**"Authentication failed"**
- Wrong username or password
- Need to use App Password instead of regular password

**"Connection could not be established"**
- Check MAIL_HOST and MAIL_PORT
